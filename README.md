## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The application follows a **mobile-first design**. Given the app's simplicity with few on-screen elements, the desktop design mirrors the mobile version with size adjustments. As the application scales and integrates features like user accounts, logins, etc., these would be incorporated into app menus. Certain new features might find their place as sections on the desktop version, making use of the additional screen space.

## 🌈 Color Palette

The chosen color palette revolves around vibrant background colors, and here's why:

- **Game-Friendly**: Vibrant background colors are apt for a gaming application, creating an engaging environment.
- **Energetic Feel**: An energetic palette adds personality and is effective in conveying emotions.
- **Design Simplification**: Opting for such a palette eliminates the need for multiple themes, such as light and dark, simplifying the design process.

## 📈 Further Development

As the application evolves, here are some considerations:

- **Feature Integration**: Features like user accounts, logins, and more would be integrated into the app's menus.
