## Angular adaptation program

In order to ensure that the code quality and architectural decisions made in this project adhere to the best practices of Angular, I've decided to embark on a series of courses once we find and agreement and prior to my incorporation. While I have experience with Angular in personal projects, continuous learning is pivotal to stay updated with the ever-evolving technological landscape. Below is the list of courses I plan to undertake, along with the reasons for choosing them. The precence of a resource doesn't imply its content is not implemented or known, just that I want to deep dive into it:

1. **[Angular Testing Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-testing-course/)**:
    - **Importance**: Testing is an indispensable part of software development. This course will provide insights into setting up a testing environment, writing unit tests, and ensuring the robustness of the Angular application. 

2. **[NgRx Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ngrx-course/)**:
    - **Importance**: State management is crucial for large applications. NgRx offers a predictable state container, making it easier to manage the application's state in an immutable fashion, ensuring consistent behavior.

3. **[Angular Forms Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-forms-course/)**:
    - **Importance**: Handling user input efficiently is a core feature of many applications. This course will delve into building reactive forms, validations, and custom form controls, ensuring a seamless user experience.

4. **[Angular Router Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-router-course/)**:
    - **Importance**: Navigation plays a vital role in any web application. This course will teach advanced routing techniques, lazy loading, and route guards, ensuring efficient navigation within the application.

5. **[RxJS and Reactive Patterns Angular Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/rxjs-reactive-angular-course/)**:
    - **Importance**: Asynchronous operations are common in web applications. RxJS provides tools to handle data streams and propagation of changes, making it easier to manage asynchronous tasks and data flows.

6. **[Angular Security Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-security/)**:
    - **Importance**: Security is paramount. This course will cover topics like authentication, authorization, and securing Angular applications against common web threats, ensuring a secure environment for users.

7. **[Angular Advanced Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-advanced-masterclass/)**:
    - **Importance**: To write efficient and scalable Angular applications, advanced architecture knowledge is necessary. This course will touch upon performance tuning, advanced components, and directives, ensuring the application remains performant.

8. **[Angular Application Architecture Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-application-architecture/)**:
    - **Importance**: A well-architected application is easier to maintain, scale, and debug. This course will provide insights into designing modular and scalable Angular applications, ensuring long-term maintainability.

By completing these courses, I aim to fortify my knowledge in Angular and ensure that the best practices are consistently followed throughout the development process of this project.

About Spring, I'm already experienced with it.

## üé® Design Philosophy

The application follows a **mobile-first design**. Given the app's simplicity with few on-screen elements, the desktop design mirrors the mobile version with size adjustments. As the application scales and integrates features like user accounts, logins, etc., these would be incorporated into app menus. Certain new features might find their place as sections on the desktop version, making use of the additional screen space.

## üåà Color Palette

The chosen color palette revolves around vibrant background colors, and here's why:

- **Game-Friendly**: Vibrant background colors are apt for a gaming application, creating an engaging environment.
- **Energetic Feel**: An energetic palette adds personality and is effective in conveying emotions.
- **Design Simplification**: Opting for such a palette eliminates the need for multiple themes, such as light and dark, simplifying the design process.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Wireframes

For a visual representation of the application's user experience and design flow, check out the wireframes. They are located in the `/docs/UX` directory of the repository. These wireframes provide insights into the initial design considerations and the overall layout of the application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/PolSurriel/front-game-trivia).
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

## üìà Further Development

As the application evolves, here are some considerations:

- **Feature Integration**: Features like user accounts, logins, and more would be integrated into the app's menus.
- **Desktop Expansion**: With more features, the desktop version could incorporate additional sections, optimizing the screen space.
